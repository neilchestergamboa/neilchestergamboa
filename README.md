### Project 1: Trae Young's Career Points Per Game Analysis

#### Project Overview:

In this data analysis project, I have meticulously tracked Trae Young's career points per game throughout his entire career in the NBA. The primary goal of this analysis is to gain insights into Trae Young's performance against specific NBA teams. To achieve this, I manually collected data from NBA.com, and after meticulous data preparation using Excel, I visualized Trae Young's career points per game using Tableau.

#### Data Collection:

I collected the data directly from NBA.com, ensuring accuracy and reliability. This manual data collection process involved gathering game-by-game statistics for Trae Young, recording the points he scored in each game, and noting the opponent team.

#### Data Preparation:

Once the raw data was gathered, I used Excel to clean and format it for analysis. Data preparation included sorting and filtering the data to isolate Trae Young's performance and calculating the average points per game for each opponent.

#### Data Visualization:

The heart of this analysis lies in the Tableau visualization. Using Tableau, I created an interactive and visually appealing dashboard that allows viewers to explore Trae Young's career points per game against different NBA teams. The visualization showcases trends, outliers, and the overall pattern of Trae Young's scoring prowess.

#### Key Insights:

Career Average Points Per Game: The analysis reveals Trae Young's career average points per game, which serves as a benchmark for his performance against individual teams.

Performance Variations: By selecting specific teams, you can quickly identify how Trae Young performed against each opponent. This can help in assessing his strengths and weaknesses against different playing styles and strategies.

Game-by-Game Analysis: The visualization also allows you to examine individual game performances, helping you identify standout games and track his consistency over time.

#### Implications:

This analysis can be valuable for coaches, analysts, and fans interested in understanding Trae Young's performance against specific teams. It can provide insights into game planning, defensive strategies, and Trae Young's impact on different matchups.

#### Future Work:

In future iterations of this project, I plan to expand the analysis by incorporating additional variables such as assists, rebounds, and turnovers to provide a more comprehensive view of Trae Young's contributions in various games.

#### Conclusion:

"Trae Young's Career Points Per Game" is an insightful analysis that showcases the power of data in understanding player performance. It offers a comprehensive view of Trae Young's scoring abilities against different NBA teams and can be a valuable resource for basketball enthusiasts, analysts, and anyone interested in the NBA.
